*Getting Started*

##Create a basic module

###Setup directories and files

Kontentblocks looks for valid modules in all registered paths.  
In an earlier step you've registered a `/modules/` path in your themes root folder.

##### Conventions

**Rule #1:** one folder per module  
**Rule #2:** folder name starts with *Module*  
**Rule #3:** main module file starts with *Module*  
**Rule #4:** class name equals file name

##### Naming 
I prefer PascalCase but using underscores is totally fine, so do as you please.
