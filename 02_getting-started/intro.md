*Getting started*

## Getting started (basics)

####Preface

The following pages cover the very basics and should give you an idea of the plugin, what it can do for you and how to start working with it.  
I will omit a lot of technical details, possibilities,  configuration options and sometimes oversimplify things to reduce the amount of information at the beginning.  
Kontentblocks is (i hope so) not a complicated plugin to work with, but it can be become complex.  
Whenever you wonder "..but can I do .." the answer is probably yes, but you won't find it in the first chapter.

####What you need to follow along


- WordPress 4.3
- PHP 5.4+

#### What you're going to do

1. Get a brief introduction.
2. Configure the plugin
3. Add areas to the 'page' post type of your theme.
4. Create a simple module with a headline field and an editor instance
5. Edit the template file to add the render hook
6. Create a twig template for the module
7. Setup inline editing for both input fields

The whole process will take approx. 15 minutes.  
Screenshots are from a vanilla WordPress 4.3 instance with a Twentyfifteen child theme.
