*Getting started*

##Terminology, work flow & concept

The core feature of Kontentblocks can be summarized as sidebars and widgets on a per-post basis.  
The term 'post' relates to any post type.  
The plugin does not share any code with WordPress sidebars and widgets, which means:  

- Kontentblocks won't affect your sidebars or widgets  
- Sidebars and widgets are not (re)usable by the plugin

So, if you have ever worked with sidebars and widgets, you already have an good idea of the basic concept.

To avoid confusion between WordPress core concepts and Kontentblocks, different terms are used:

####Module

Similar to a WordPress widget, a module is basically a container with a form for user input on the back-end and (HTML) output on the front-end.  

#### Areas 

An area, like a WordPress sidebar, is basically a container for modules.

#### Context

You might know this term from meta boxes.
A context is basically a container for areas.  
The post edit screen can be divided into different contexts, and a context can hold multiple areas.
