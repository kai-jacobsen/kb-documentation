*Getting started*

##Terminology, work flow & concept

The core feature of Kontentblocks can be summarized as sidebars and widgets on a per-post basis.  
'Post' relates to any post type.  
The plugin does not share any code with WordPress sidebars and widgets, which means:  

a) Kontentblocks won't affect your sidebars or widgets  
b) Sidebars and widgets are not (re)usable by the plugin
