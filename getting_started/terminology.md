#Terminology

For the sake of simplicity and a better understanding at the beginning: think of Kontentblocks as a extended version of the native sidebars/widgets concept. They have some in common but are two completly seperated things (yet). 

Throughout the documentation, area and modules will play a big role.

An **area** is to Kontentblocks what a sidebar is to WordPress. A hook, a context where **modules** get attached to.  
A **module** is to Kontentblocks what a widget is to WordPress. The thing wihich gets attached to areas.

As simple as important.
